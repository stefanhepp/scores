INTRO
=====

This repository contains some transcriptions done by me from various sources (audio-recordings, MIDI-files, youtube videos, ..).

I do not take any credit for the original music or most of the arrangements (although a few pieces are arranged for solo piano or 
for another instrument by me). In most cases I used MIDI-files recorded by other people as primary source and created readable sheet music from
them. Most of those files have been lying around on my harddisk forever by now, so I do not have all the links to the webpages anymore.

USED SOFTWARE
==============

o) Youtube Videos
- Mozilla Firefox, Flashgot Addon: To get a .flv file
- FLV_Extract: To get the audio part from the .flv video
  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/FLV_Extract
- foobar2000: To convert the .aac audio file to MP3

o) Audio/Youtube Files
- Audacity: To convert .mp3 to .wav and split it into chunks
- Melodyne Editor Demo: To get (most of) the notes 
- Avidemux: For videos where I can see the hands :)

o) Midi Files
- VirtualBox: Used to run Linux for Rosegarden when working under Windows.
- Rosegarden: To open MIDI-files and display them as score or as piano roll. 

o) Creating the scores
- MuseScore: Opensource score WYSIWYG editor
  http://musescore.org/
- LilyPond: Used to create PDF-files after exporting the score to .ly format.
  While this is not necessary, lilypond creates better sheet music layout than MuseScore.
- OpenOffice Draw: To create the covers. Because GIMP's text edit features are a pain and I could not get Inkscape to
  do what I want (but maybe I will in the future..).

o) Other
- SCons: To automate Lilypond export and PDF creation
  http://www.scons.org/

Why MuseScore? MuseScore has now a first stable release, and although it still has some rough edges, most things you 
usually need do work. Furthermore 
- it is free. In contrast to some other programs you do not have to pay your first-born to use it. You can use it 
  for free not only to view and listen to the scores, but also to edit them yourself.
- it is open source. I am able to edit/extend it to my needs (especially the MIDI import for recorded piano scores).
- it is cross-platform. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
- it is WYSIWYG. While creating documents using markup languages like LaTeX or LilyPond has its advantages (usually in the quality 
  of the resulting layout), it is a real pain when it comes to things like transposing or experimenting with the finer details of the
  arrangement.
